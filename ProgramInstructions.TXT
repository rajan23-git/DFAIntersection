PROJECT TITLE: Calculating DFA intersection given two base DFAs


PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
the purpose of this project is to read in the transition tables from two separate DFA text files.
Using the information read, the program constructs the intersection of the DFA
by constructing the transition table that pertains to the intersection,
and then printing out that transition table to a destination text file.


VERSION or DATE: November 20, 2021


HOW TO START THIS PROJECT AND USER INSTRUCTIONS: 
to modify the two input text files, directly edit them on bluejay.
To run this program right click on Main class square. A drop down menu appears
giving you options such as: new Main() and void main(String[] args). Click the 
option called "void main(String [] args)". This begins the program.On program
entry the user is prompted for the accept states and the start state of the first DFA. Type these in.
The user is then prompted for the accept states and start state of the second DFA.Type these in.
The program then runs to completion.The accept states and start state of the intersection DFA 
are printed to the console. To view the transition table of the intersected DFA
open up DFA_Intersected.txt.
